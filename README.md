# Bookbot
Bookbot is a Python project that takes a book in .txt format and summarizes information about it. Specifically, it provides two pieces of information: 1) the total number of words in the book, and 2) the frequency of each English alphabet in the book.

This project is a part of my learning experience on Github.
